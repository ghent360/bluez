Bluetooth Mesh Daemon
*********************

Copyright (C) 2019  Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.

Compilation and installation
============================

In addition to main BlueZ requirements, MeshCtl needs the following:
	- json-c library

Configuration and options
=========================

	--enable-mesh

		Build mesh daemon and other Bluetooth Mesh based tools

Current implementation of the mesh daemon requires exclusive access to
a Bluetooth controller.
The AutoEnable option in the installed main.conf should be set to "false".

Storage
=======

Default storage directory is /var/lib/bluetooth/mesh.

The directory contains the provisioned nodes configurations.
Each node has its own subdirectory, named after node's Device UUID (32-digit
hexadecimal string) that is generated by the application that created a node.

Each subdirectory contains the following files:
	- node.json:
		node configuration and is populated by the
		daemon based on the configuration commands from a
		provisioner/configuration client
	- node.json.bak:
		a backup that the last known good node configuration.
	- seq_num:
		File containing next sequence number to use
	- seq_num.bak:
		Backup of the sequence number. This may be larger than the
		actual sequence number being used at runtime, to prevent re-use
		of sequence numbers in the event of an unexpected restart.
	- ./rpl/:
		Directory to store the sequence numbers of remote nodes, as
		required by Replay Protection List (RPL) parameters.
		- xxxx:
			Files named for remote Unicast addresses, and contain
			last received iv_index + seq_num from each SRC address.
	- ./dev_keys/:
		Directory to store remote Device keys. This is only created/used
		by Configuration Client (Network administration) nodes.
		- xxxx:
			Files named for remote Unicast addresses, and contains
			16 octet key.
	- ./net_keys/:
		Directory to store network subnet keys. This is only
		created/used by Configuration Client (Network administration)
		nodes.
		- xxx:
			Files named for subnet index, and contains key refresh
			phase, and old/new versions of the key.
	- ./app_keys/:
		Directory to store application keys. This is only created/used
		by Configuration Client (Network administration) nodes.
		- xxx:
			Files named for application index, and contains bound
			subnet index, and old/new versions of the key.

The node.json and node.json.bak are in JSON format. All other files are stored
in little endian binary format.
